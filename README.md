1. idp_extraction - link to files used to extract IDPs from MRI images within UK Biobank
2. phenotype_creation - files to establish and explore neuroendocrine phenotypes
3. GWAS - files to run GWAS and downstream processing
4. exome - files to analyse exome-wide association analysis data
5. phewas - files to run phenome-wide association analysis
6. coloc - files to run colocalisation analysis
7. hormones - files to run analysis looking for associations between neuroendocrine phenotypes, and reproductive hormone and infertility phenotypes
8. celltype_enrichment - files to run cell type enrichment analysis
9. replication - files to run replication GWAS and associated analyses
